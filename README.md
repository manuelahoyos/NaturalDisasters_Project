# NaturalDisasters_Project
Group project in which data about natural disasters around the globe were analyzed and results were visualized using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, JavaScript, D3 and HTML/CSS.


## Comparison of Average Land Temperature and Earthquake Magnitude Using JavaScript and D3:

The datasets ‘GlobalLandTemperatures.csv’and ‘Earthquakes.csv’were cleaned using Python and Pandas to calculate the average land temperature and the average magnitude of earthquakes during the years 2000 - 2012. This data was selected for the countries Turkey, Iran, Greece and Pakistan and the finalized DataFrames were exported as csv files. 

The comparison between average land temperature and average magnitude of earthquakes was plotted using JavaScript and D3. A scatterplot was created within the app.js file using JavaScript and D3. The data was pulled from the csv files and the d3.select() function was used to append the graph into the HTML file. CSS was used for both the HTML page styling and the scatterplot styling. D3 was used for animations, transitions, click events on the y labels, and tooltips when the cursor hovers over the state circles.
